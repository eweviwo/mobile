# Mobile App
The stage of this document serves as a rough idea for work to begin. It only explains concept, development and sketch for the mobile app. The document will evolve in technical output according to the code base of this repo. 

## Concept
- The mobile app will have a clean user interface and be easily navigable. 
- The mobile app will solely be for the content experience. It will not have a login to work or monitor the project. 
- The colour theme for the project will not be flashy. The desired mood is calm. 

## Development

- Programming of choice will be [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) although [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) will not be totally excluded. 
- Cross-platform framework of choice will be [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) will be used together with React Native.

## Sketch
A one page sketch is drawn below to show an idea of the mobile app flow. It is not a strict guideline but a desired guideline however the engineering challenges. The sketch has some numbering that will be explained below.
1. Menu Overflow: This will show links to useful pages or features. 
2. Dynamic Headline: This will show season and other information dynamically according to what is being scrolled. 
3. Scrollable: This will enable users to scroll content list. 
4. Library Pane: This will allow users to organise or select content of interest. It will later have added features for increased learning activity. 
5. All Content Pane: All content will be listed on this page.
6. Content: Podcasts will be listed. Playback menu position will be figured out.
